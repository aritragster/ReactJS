1. download IDE visual studio code
2. np install --> npm install create-react-app -g.....tool to create es6 application
3. project creation --> create-react-app <APP_NAME>
	set npm path variable - C:\Users\njai49\AppData\Roaming\npm
4. "code ." --> command not found (open folder/app in visual studio)

INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT/LANGUAGE FUNDAMENTALS
------------------------------------------------

What is JS?
1.  Js is programming language
2.  Js is multi-paradign == functional programming + object oriented programming
3.  Js is functional object oriented pl
4.  Js is dynamic typed pl --> no type is specified during compiled type, it is decided during runtime
5.  Js was created for web browser programming only, but now its everywhere (browser, server, mobile)

JavaScript History:
1.  Created 1995-1996
2.  First name-> mocha, later->Live Script then JavaScript
3.  Created by Brendan Eich
4.  Standard body for scripting languages(as well as JS) --> ECMA  (European Computer Manufacturers Association) 1997
5.  1997 -> JavaScript first version was released - javascript 1.0/ es 1/ ecma 1
6.  second version --> es 3/ ecma 3
7.  2005 -> AJAX introduced
8.  2008 - ES 4
9.  2009 - ES 5 (most stable version till today)
10. 2012 - ES 6   > 30+ new changes added --> only small code needs to be written
                  > major improvements
                  > browsers were not able to support all the features
11. TRANSPILLARS were introduced > Special type of compiler (ES6 to ES5 compilation)
                                 > Source code to source code compilation
                                 > Google tracer (google's transpillar) -> failed
                                 > BabelJS (stable transpillar) https://babeljs.io/
12. now, latest browsers support ES6, but older verions do not.
13. Better ES6 --> TypeScript 
14. Now ES6 can be downgraded up to ES3 using babelJS---windows XP & 98
15. 2015 - ES 6 final draft released
16. 2016 - ES 7 proposal started > experimental


PROGRAMMING SECTION
-------------------
Javascript literal:
string,number,boolean,undefined,NaN,Infinity,function,null,object


//Javascript and module programming
//design patterns for linking files in JS (anologous to class loader in java)
//1. AMD  2. common.js require.js(tool based on common.js requirements)
//webpack - module bundler, linking of files
